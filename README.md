ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @drou0302! Currently working as PostDoc at the University of Bern (CH).
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in bioinformatics, specially focused on protein structural analysis, docking and molecular dynamics pipelines.
ğŸŒ± I started learning python in order to automatize some common jobs in our lab, and was amazed by it's capabilities and potential!
